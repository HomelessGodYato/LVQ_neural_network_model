# LVQ neural network model implementation.

This project is based on [FilipHanzel](https://github.com/FilipHanzel/lvq) model.
Implemented some experiments for testing LVQ model, funtion for data analysis, function for making plots.
Used pandas library instead of iterating through dataset file. Used sklearn library for making confussion matrices and better visualisation.
For plots used seaborn and matplotlib packages.
